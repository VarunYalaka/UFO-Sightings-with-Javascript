## Overview of Project
Dana researching UFOs and planning to create an interactive webpage that allows readers to parse the data around UFO sightings. She is aware that Java script is clearly capable of a variety of tasks. First she would like to create a filterable table to display the data. To do this, she needs to build two things: the webpage that will allow users to view the data (HTML) and a dynamic table that will present it (JavaScript).

## Summary
### Drawbacks 
1. search criteria is case sensitive. 

2. Unable to search using uppercase letters, showing zero results. 

3. We are not providing any information about the available filter suggestions.

### Recommendations
1. Nice to provide an error message for a wrong search. 

2. For city, shape and state - dropdown will give a clear idea about the available filter suggestions.   

3. We should provide “Search” or “submit button” for a better user experience.
